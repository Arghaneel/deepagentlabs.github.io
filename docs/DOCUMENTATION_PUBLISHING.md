# Documentation publishing

The homepage's Docs menu links to repository-owned documentation. Keep the
source in the product repositories; do not maintain a second copy here.

| URL | Source | Publisher |
|---|---|---|
| `/agenticlens/docs/` | `agenticlens/docs` | AgenticLens Pages workflow |
| `/agentic-sidecar/docs/` | `agentic-sidecar/website/docs` | Sidecar Pages workflow |
| `/agentic-chaos/docs/` | `agentic-chaos/docs` | Chaos Pages workflow |
| `/agentic-evals/docs/` | `agentic-evals/docs/docs/index.html` | Evals Pages branch deployment |
| `/mcp/docs/` | `mcp-server/docs` and its MkDocs config | This website's Pages workflow |
| `/control-tower/docs/` | `agenticops-control-tower/docs`, README and examples | This website's Pages workflow |

The MCP and Tower paths differ from their repository names, so this website
builds them into its deployment artifact. Product pages and other website
assets are preserved. The workflow fetches both repositories' `main` branches
on website pushes, daily, or when manually dispatched. Pull requests build an
artifact without deploying. Documentation source is never executed as Python;
only the MkDocs configuration is loaded. Source repositories are trusted inputs.

Local preview (run from this repository, with sibling repositories available):

```sh
uv run --no-project --with-requirements scripts/docs-requirements.txt \
  python scripts/build_docs.py --sources .. --output /tmp/dal-docs/site
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory /tmp/dal-docs/site
```

Open `/mcp/docs/` and `/control-tower/docs/`. The script writes generated output
and Tower staging files outside the source repositories.

For the first website deployment, select **GitHub Actions** under the website
repository's Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source. Merge the
workflow and builder, then run **Website and repository docs**. This replaces
the website's branch-only deployment with one artifact containing the website
and both generated documentation trees.

Sidecar and Chaos also require **GitHub Actions** as their Pages source;
serving their Markdown source folders directly does not expose the workflows'
`site/docs` output. Their Pages settings were corrected and docs workflows
redispatched during the 2026-10-21 audit.

Evals currently serves a handwritten HTML guide. Its additional Markdown files
are not automatically converted into pages by that branch deployment.
