# Website changelog

What changed on the DeepAgentLabs website, newest first. For how the site is put
together, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## October 2026

### Control Tower command-center scenarios (October 21)

Expanded use case 06 beyond fleet review with two operations scenarios. Added
scripted MCP + Copilot evidence correlation and cited root cause, a recommended
runbook requiring human approval, separate remediation and recovery verification,
including a failed probe that keeps the incident open. Added emergency stop,
new-call blocking, scoped access revocation, a call-gate probe and separate access
restoration. Kept resume, approval, evidence and recovery states independent.
Updated the hero and index to reflect Control Tower's broader OPERATE role.

### Control Tower fleet use case (October 21)

Added `/usecases/6/` from the supplied fleet operations use-case document.
Includes eight fictional agent deployments, environment/team/search filters,
producer-attributed evidence, proposal approval/rejection/change requests,
scoped emergency-brake confirmation, resume and per-agent decision records.
Approval is separate from execution, and operator state remains separate from
reported health and native evidence. Added the sixth index card and navigation
link. Controls are clearly labeled conceptual with no infrastructure connection.

### Risk-based Sidecar approval (October 21)

Read-only external API, MCP and vector queries now skip human review after their
automated checks. A critical $25 refund action demonstrates the approval hold.
The approval card stays inactive and says “not required” for read-only calls.
Verified both execution paths with a controlled browser clock.

### Automatic Sidecar supervision simulation (October 21)

Added a new passive use case 05: an agent proposes external API, MCP, vector
and action-tool calls, with guardrails, context, self-critique and scripted human
approval before every execution. Colored stages brighten automatically at
one-second intervals. Results feed the next context re-injection. Added the fifth
index card and Sidecar navigation link. Includes visibility-aware playback,
reduced-motion support and fictional approval/execution disclosures.


### Animated AgenticOps walkthrough (October 21)

Polished the loop with gradient cards, icons, a dotted canvas, active-stage
highlights and a central progress ring. Added animated connector packets and
Play/Pause, Next and Restart controls. The walkthrough groups Chaos and Evals
as parallel checks, pauses outside the viewport, and respects reduced motion.
Verified playback, pause, stage inspection and responsive layouts.

### Code-rendered AgenticOps loop (October 21)

Added the supplied production-to-redeployment loop below use case 03 as native
HTML/CSS with inline SVG arrows. Eleven keyboard-accessible stages explain their
role on selection. The diagram preserves the Chaos and Evals branches and the
feedback path, with a vertical layout on smaller screens. Verified selection,
keyboard activation and stage layout at phone, tablet and desktop widths.

### AgenticLens nested call graph (October 21)

Replaced the use case 04 waterfall with an interactive call graph showing a root
agent calling MCP, an external API, a vector database and subagents. Nested
subagent branches expose web, tools, models, retrieval and memory calls; a subagent
also delegates to another subagent. Each node opens captured span details.
Retained token attribution, diagnostics, comparison and export with consistent
parent-child data. Verified node drilldown and responsive layouts in the browser.

### AgenticLens observability use case (October 21)

Added `/usecases/4/`, a dark observability dashboard with nested agent, model,
tool, retrieval, retry and memory spans. Includes a clickable waterfall and
inspector, agent topology, overall/per-agent input and output tokens, fictional
cost attribution, trace search/status/time filters, evidence-backed diagnostics,
a fixed-cohort comparison and simplified JSON export. Added the fourth index
card and linked it from the AgenticLens menu. All telemetry is labeled simulated.
Browser checks cover workflows and layouts at 360, 768 and 1440 pixels.

### Interactive ecosystem use cases (October 21)

Added a generic index at `/usecases/` and three linked concept demos
at `/usecases/1/`, `/usecases/2/`, `/usecases/3/`, following the supplied PDF numbering.
Includes scripted MCP conversations, fault-injection replay, optimization evidence,
recording import/export, baseline evaluation and candidate release comparisons.
All data is labeled illustrative. Preserves the site's shared branding and navigation.
Verified the workflows, reset behavior and responsive widths with Playwright.


### Shared product documentation (October 21)

- Standardized all six products on a shared MkDocs Material theme with product navigation, grouped sidebars, search, theme switching and page contents.
- Kept existing documentation paths and repository-owned content. Added a tutorial authoring template and per-product `llms.txt` indexes.
- Migrated Evals from its single HTML guide to searchable Markdown pages, with redirects for old section bookmarks.
- Added rendered link and navigation checks to documentation deployments.

### Control Tower page: livelier hero
- Entrance animation: the headline rises in and the lime highlight sweeps across, then the text, buttons and install line follow; the fleet card slides in (rises in on phones), its bar grows and the agent rows appear one by one.
- The fleet card now has a **Recent activity** feed: new events slide in as the simulated fleet changes ("invoice-agent recovered → healthy", "ops-runner stopped checking in", heartbeats).
- New numbers strip under the hero that counts up when it comes into view: 6 tools in the catalog · 4 health states · 1 command to install · 0 bytes sent to DeepAgentLabs when you self-host.
- All motion is off with "reduce motion".

### Control Tower page: layout polish
- Less empty space between sections (especially under the hero).
- Two ways to run it: Self-hosted is now a dark card with a lime shadow (the one available today), Hosted a light dashed card with an amber "planned" badge, for clearer contrast.
- How it works: one wide row per step (number, what to do, and the command on the right) instead of four narrow columns.
- FAQ: a short intro and a "Still have questions?" box (Discord, GitHub issues) fill the left column.

### Control Tower page: features carousel
- "What it does" is now a dark section like modern product sites: heading on the left, a short paragraph on the right, and four large feature cards (Fleet registry, Health status, Capability coverage, Tool finder & catalog) that scroll sideways. Each card shows a framed close-up from the console (`control-tower/img/feat-*.webp`) with a title and description. Arrows, a progress line, keyboard arrows, swipe and mouse-drag all work.
- Removed the "What teams use it for" section from the Control Tower page.
- New section order: hero, why it exists, what it does, two ways to run it, inside the console, how it works, health, ecosystem, status, FAQ.

### Control Tower page
- New page at `/control-tower/` (the Products menu's Control Tower link opens it). Content now matches the Control Tower console prototype.
- Hero: "Every agent, one place.", **Open Control Tower ↗** (https://controltower.deepagentlabs.io) and GitHub, `pip install agenticops-control-tower`, key facts (v0.2.0 on PyPI, pre-alpha; self-hosted data stays on your machine) and a simulated live fleet card.
- **Inside the console:** real screenshots (Chat tool finder, Fleet, capability coverage, dark theme) in `control-tower/img/`, cropped to the frame size (816×510) so they show at full sharpness. The list moves to the next screen every 5 s and loops (progress bar on the active item); clicking an item jumps there and the cycle carries on; it pauses only while a screenshot is enlarged; click a screenshot to enlarge it.
- **Two ways to run it:** self-hosted (available as a Python package, data stays local) vs hosted (planned, preview only), with account / where it runs / where data lives / install.
- **How it works** with the real commands (`serve --snapshot …`, `status`; ship in the next release, need the `api` extra), health states including Unknown, the catalog table (AgenticLens v0.5.0 … Control Tower v0.2.0 with stages), Status (available now / next release / preview / planned) and an updated FAQ.
- Full-width white and dark bands, sections fade in on scroll; reduce motion turns animations off.

### Spacing fixes and hero intro
- Clear space after the logo at every desktop width (it was only 16px on most screens); menu spacing is set per width so all items still fit on one row.
- Docs and Use cases menus: link rows back to normal spacing; the dark card is more compact instead (its one-line description hides on narrower desktops), so there is no empty band at the bottom.
- The hero now tells first-time visitors who we are: the intro adds "We write one open standard for operating AI agents and build free tools on top of it.", and a short row under the buttons covers **Who we are** (an open-source AI research and learning community), **What we build** (one open spec and six free tools) and **Who it's for** (anyone running agents; any framework, runs locally). It replaces the Language-neutral / Framework-agnostic / Local-first checkmarks.

### Dropdown arrows and menu order
- New menu order: **Platform, Products, Docs, Use cases**, then the plain links.
- All four dropdowns show a small arrow (chevron) after the name, so visitors can see they open a menu without hovering. It flips while the menu is open. Desktop only; phones keep the +/- boxes.
- Removed the first-visit "New here?" tip (`assets/js/nav-hint.js` deleted).
- Menu spacing adjusted so everything still fits on one row at every desktop width.

### Use cases menu
- New **Use cases** dropdown in the top menu (homepage and roadmap page), after Docs (last of the dropdowns). It reuses the Products / Docs markup, styling and `nav.js` behaviour (hover or click on desktop, accordion inside the phone menu).
- Same layout as the Products and Docs menus: one item per package (AgenticLens, Agentic Chaos, Agentic Sidecar, Agentic Evals, MCP Server, Control Tower) with its icon, "<name> use cases" and a short line, linking to `/<package>/usecases/`. Individual use cases are linked from the "Most asked" chips and live at `/<package>/usecases/<slug>/`.
- The menu content lives in one data file, `assets/js/usecases-data.js`, and is built by `assets/js/usecases.js`, so use cases can be renamed or relinked without touching the HTML. The use cases listed now are placeholders. Packages link to `/<package>/usecases/`, use cases to `/<package>/usecases/<slug>/` (or any `href` set in the data file).
- A dark "Start here" card on the right, like the Docs menu, links to the most asked use cases and invites people to share theirs on Discord.
- Until the pages exist, `404.html` shows a "Use cases · coming soon" page naming the use case, with the framework's GitHub and PyPI links.

### Synced with the live site
- The **Build with us** band now comes before the newsletter, so the newsletter sign-up sits just above the footer.
- Added the **Remote MCP** link (`https://mcp.deepagentlabs.io`) from the live site to the top menu on every page and to the footer's Explore column.
- Desktop menu items no longer wrap onto two lines; spacing tightens on narrower desktop screens.

### Footer
- A short company statement as the first footer column: "Open infrastructure for observable, efficient and resilient AI agents, built in the open", with four plain-language principles: Spec comes first, Works with any framework, Runs on your machine, Free and open source.
- New dark footer on every page: **Products** (each framework's GitHub repo), **Explore** (Specification, Roadmap, Capability map, Frameworks, FAQ) and **Community** columns.
- A bottom bar with ©, the spec status ("v0.1 in review") and **Back to top**.
- Footer links have no ↗ arrows.
- Big centred wordmark above the bottom bar: "DeepAgent" in off-white and "Labs" in lime (heading font). A lime sheen passes over "DeepAgent" every 6 seconds.

### Community
- The community links live in the lime **Build with us** band at the bottom of the homepage (one section instead of two): the call to action and one line of what the community does (Workshops, Technical sessions, Research, Open source), each with a small icon on the left, one ink row each for Discord, LinkedIn, Instagram and GitHub on the right. All four icons use the same black square with a lime icon.
- "Community" in the Platform menu jumps to that band. Footer on every page links LinkedIn, Instagram, Discord and GitHub with icons; LinkedIn now uses `/company/deepagentlabs`.

### Border beam animation
- Inspired by [Beam](https://libraries.dev/beam), rebuilt in plain CSS/JS in the site's lime and ink (the original is a React package with a rainbow glow).
- A streak of light travels around the hero ecosystem card, the framework showcase, the downloads card, the milestone that's in review (homepage and roadmap page), the spec card in the menus, and the 404 card.
- Primary buttons get a quick beam on hover; the newsletter form gets one while you're typing your email.
- Beams pause when off screen and are turned off for reduced motion.

### Loading screen removed
- The full-screen boot animation is gone. The homepage opens straight onto the hero, which still has its own short entrance animation. Its markup, styles (about 65 lines of CSS) and scripts were deleted, not just hidden.

### Phone layouts
- **What each framework actually does** is an accordion on phones: seven rows with a +/− button, one card open at a time, no sideways tab strip and no auto-advance. The card no longer repeats the framework name, and long `pip install` commands wrap.
- **Ecosystem adoption**: one compact row per package (name and number side by side) instead of a tall block each.
- **Roadmap**: milestone cards in two columns.
- **Capability map**: package cards show just their name and role until tapped (or until "Full detail" is on).
- Homepage on a phone is about 1,500px shorter. Desktop is unchanged.

### Quality pass (frontend standard)
- Header is now sticky on every page, with a full-width paper background; jump links land just below it.
- One consistent keyboard focus ring; hover animations shortened to under 0.3s and the menu pill no longer bounces.
- Phones: the Menu button sits flush right in the site colours with an icon, and changes to **Close** while open. Roadmap code samples wrap instead of widening the page.
- New `404.html`. Menu links to product and docs pages that aren't built yet now show a branded "coming soon" page with that product's GitHub and PyPI links, instead of GitHub's default 404.
- The hero card shows a "Live" badge with a pulsing green dot.

### Repository structure
- Assets split into `assets/css/`, `assets/js/` and `assets/img/`. Unused files were removed (trial colour themes, the unused second ecosystem image, saved screenshots).
- Docs moved into `docs/`: this changelog, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the engineering notes in `docs/ecosystem/`.
- Renamed files: `bg-flow.*` → `background.*`, `arch-theme.css` → `architecture-theme.css`, `arch-compact.js` → `architecture-compact.js`, `DAL logo.png` → `img/dal-logo.png`, `deepagentlabs-ecosystem.png` → `img/ecosystem.png`.

### Header and navigation
- Mega-menus for **Products** (six product pages), **Docs** (six `/docs` pages with install commands, a quickstart and "On PyPI" links) and **Platform** (Loop, Dashboards, Why us, Roadmap).
- Architecture, FAQ, Specification, Roadmap and GitHub are top-level links.
- A lime pill slides behind the hovered item. On phones the menus become accordions.
- The product and docs pages (`/agenticlens`, `/agenticlens/docs`, …) do not exist yet and will 404 until they are added.

### Look and feel
- Green / white / black theme. Headlines use Bricolage Grotesque, body text Inter, and highlighted key words Instrument Serif italic on a lime marker.
- Section labels have a lime underline. The operating loop is a dark band. "Why us" uses contrasting tiles.
- A quiet animated background: faint dark-green signals move slowly along the page grid.

### Capability map (`#architecture`)
- Restyled in the site theme: white cards, an ink Control Tower, and the lime Specification as the only filled accent.
- Compact by default. "Full detail" shows everything, and selecting a package shows all its capabilities.
- An "Interactive map" hint, "Details ↓" tags on hover, and a details panel that scrolls into view when you click something.
- Package-to-package lines are no longer drawn, because they crossed other cards. They are still listed under "Connected components" in the details panel.

### What each framework actually does (`#dashboards`)
- Renamed from "What each tool actually does"; the section now talks about frameworks.
- One tabbed panel instead of seven tall cards. Hover (desktop) or click a framework to switch, and it auto-advances until the visitor interacts.
- Each panel shows the framework's full card: description, capabilities, sample output, `pip install` command with a **copy button**, a **PyPI** link and a GitHub link.

### Ecosystem adoption (`#adoption`)
- One dark stat card with the total downloads and one cell per package. Numbers count up from 0 the first time the card is seen.
- Each package has **PyPI** and **Download stats** links.

### Roadmap
- The homepage section sits above the FAQ: eight milestone cards with status, a progress rail, and links to each phase.
- New `roadmap.html`: hero with progress meter, milestone ticker, four promises, a dark milestone section with one animated illustration per phase, the gates for the next release, and a call to review the spec.

## Earlier
- First-visit agent boot screen, homepage animation layer (scroll progress, hero reveal, package ticker, reveal-on-scroll), FAQ section, and section copy updates.
